Principal author **Dhairya Malhotra**, with additional code by **Alex Barnett**.
This work was done at the Center for Computational Mathematics at the Flatiron Institute, NY, NY.

This is a high-performance parallel C++ implementation of a high-order
adaptive Nystr√∂m quadrature for the boundary integral equations arising
in 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet and rigid mobility boundary-value problems
for closed loop filaments of arbitrarily small circular cross-section.
Its quadrature setup cost is independent of the slenderness parameter, being around 20000 unknowns/sec per core, at 6-digit accuracy, away from close-to-touching regions.
Close-to-touching geometries may be handled to close to machine accuracy using adaptivity.
Open-ended fibers with rounded ends are possible and will be added soon.

This repository also contains MATLAB codes implementing the classical
slender-body theory asymptotic approximation,
and solving its linear inverse problem as needed for a mobility solve.

It is research software; use at your own risk. The following figures show some of the capabilities of the code (see the publication below for details).

Minimum requirements to compile:
---------------------------------

C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard

Optional libraries for better performance:
-------------------------------------------

BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, MPI (distributed memory parallelism), PVFMM

Instructions:
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dmalhotra/CSBQ.git
    cd CSBQ
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    # update Makefile as necessary
    make
    ./bin/demo1-geometry

For visualization do (after installing PARAVIEW):

.. code-block:: bash

    make && ./bin/demo1-geometry && paraview vis/ring.pvtu

Overview:
---------

This is a header-only C++ library: you only need to ``#include <csbq.hpp>`` in your code.
It relies on the `SCTL <https://github.com/dmalhotra/SCTL>`_ library (included as a submodule) and the path to ``sctl.hpp`` must be provided to the C++ compiler.
The included Makefile may be used as a template for new projects.
Everything is contained within ``sctl::`` namespace.
Demo codes for learning to use the library are provided in ``tutorial/``.
Precomputed quadrature tables for Laplace and Stokes kernels and some geometry files are provided in ``data/``.
Test codes used to generate the results in the paper are provided in ``test/``, along with SLURM scripts in ``scripts/``.

For slender-body numerical implementations in MATLAB, see ``SBT/`` directory.
