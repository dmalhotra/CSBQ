`CSBQ <https://github.com/dmalhotra/CSBQ>`_ is a high-performance parallel C++ implementation of a high-order
adaptive Nystr√∂m quadrature for the boundary integral equations arising
in 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet and rigid mobility boundary-value problems
for closed loop filaments of arbitrarily small circular cross-section.
Its quadrature setup cost is independent of the slenderness parameter, being around 20000 unknowns/sec per core, at 6-digit accuracy, away from close-to-touching regions.
Close-to-touching geometries may be handled to close to machine accuracy using adaptivity.
Open-ended fibers with rounded ends are possible and will be added soon.

This repository also contains MATLAB codes implementing the classical
slender-body theory asymptotic approximation,
and solving its linear inverse problem as needed for a mobility solve.

It is research software; use at your own risk. The following figures show some of the capabilities of the code (see the publication below for details).
